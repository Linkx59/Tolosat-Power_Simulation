Solar panel degradation estimation is fine for at least 8 years;
Fluence doesn't take into account the orientation of the solar panel

Things to do:
- Thermal impacts on solar panel efficiency
- Thermal impacts on battery
- charge and discharge impacts on battery

-depth of charge degradation

-Real output of power




Info:
1 Battery charge cycle is the equivalent of discharging it fully and recharging it fully even if it is in multiple use. Example 100% -> 50% -> 100% -> 50% -> 100% is one cycle
